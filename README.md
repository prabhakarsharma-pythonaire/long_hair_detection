**Long Hair Detection App**
This application uses deep learning models to predict age, gender, and hair length from uploaded images. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, which allows users to easily upload an image and receive predictions.

**Features**
Age Prediction: Estimates the age of the person in the image.
Gender Classification: Determines the gender of the person in the image.
Hair Length Detection: Classifies hair length as short or long if the personâ€™s age is between 20 and 30 years old.


**Technologies**

Python: Programming language used for development.
Tkinter: GUI toolkit for building the application interface.
OpenCV: Library for image processing.
PIL (Pillow): Library for handling images.
TensorFlow/Keras: Framework for building and loading deep learning models.

**Requirements**
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
tensorflow
opencv-python
pillow
numpy
tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
You can install the required packages using pip:

**bash**
Copy code
pip install tensorflow opencv-python pillow numpy
Setup
Clone the Repository:

**bash**
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Place Model Files:
Make sure you have the model files (hair_length_model.h5, gender_classification_model.h5, and age_prediction_model.h5) in the same directory as app.py.

**Add Icon File:**
Ensure the icon file OIP.jpeg is also placed in the same directory as app.py.

**Usage**
Run the Application:

**bash**
Copy code
python app.py
Using the GUI:

Click the "Upload Image" button to select an image file from your computer.
The application will process the image and display the predicted age, gender, and hair length (if applicable).
Code Overview
app.py: Main application file that defines the GUI and functionality.
OIP.jpeg: Icon file for the application window.
Key Components
predict_age_hair_gender(image): Function that processes the image and returns predictions.
App class: Defines the Tkinter GUI, including labels, buttons, and image processing.
