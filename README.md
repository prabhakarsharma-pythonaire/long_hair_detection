## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately detecting and classifying images based on whether they contain people with long hair. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a curated dataset to achieve this goal.

## Features

* **Binary Classification:** The model focuses on distinguishing between images with people having long hair and those without.
* **Real-time Detection:**  The architecture is optimized for efficient inference, enabling potential real-time applications.
